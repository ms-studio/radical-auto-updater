# Radical-Auto-Updater

A plugin (best used as must-use-plugin) that enables all Automatic Background Updates for WordPress: Core updates, Plugin updates, Theme updates, Translation file updates

This plugin is going to retire with the release of WordPress 5.6 scheduled for 2020.

## Background

Automatic updates were introduced with WordPress 3.7 in 2013. In 2015, I was created this mini-plugin, as I used this functionality on many sites.

With WordPress version 5.5 in 2020, the ability to to turn on auto-updates for plugins and themes was added to Core. Version 5.6 [will introduce an auto-updates interface](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/11/02/introducing-auto-updates-interface-for-core-major-versions-in-wordpress-5-6/) for Core major versions.
