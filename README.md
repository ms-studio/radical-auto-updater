# Radical-Auto-Updater

A plugin (best used as must-use-plugin) that enables all Automatic Background Updates for WordPress: Core updates, Plugin updates, Theme updates, Translation file updates

This plugin has been made redundant by the release of WordPress 5.6 in December 2020. Don't expect any updates to this plugin.

## Background

Automatic updates were introduced with WordPress 3.7 in 2013. In 2015, I created this mini-plugin, as I used this functionality on many sites.

- With WordPress version 5.5 in 2020, the ability to to turn on auto-updates **for plugins and themes** was added to Core. 
- Version 5.6 [has introduced an auto-updates interface](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/11/24/core-major-versions-auto-updates-ui-changes-in-wordpress-5-6-correction/) for Core major versions.
